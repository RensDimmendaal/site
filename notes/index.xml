      <title>HOW TO: Automate creation of conda environments</title>

      <description>Do you:
 Always have to google how to create a new environment? Forget to activate the right environment? Forget the name of your conda environments?  Then these aliases for your .bashrc or .zshrc file might help.
function mkconda() { dir=$(echo $PWD | rev | cut -d/ -f1 | rev) conda create -n $1 -y python=3.7 conda deactivate conda activate $1 }  This gives you the option to run mkconda and it will create a new conda environment with the same name as the current directory.</description>

      <description>Inline plotting in the terminal is useful if you want to do some quick analysis without launching a full jupyter notebook. I&amp;rsquo;m going to show you how to get inline plots in ipython console with iterm2.
First, install this python package called imgcat:
$ pip install imgcat  Second, fire up an ipython console and run:
import matplotlib matplotlib.use(&amp;quot;module://imgcat&amp;quot;) import matplotlib.pyplot as plt fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax = plt.plot([1,2]) fig.</description>

      <title>HOW TO: downsample with pandas</title>

      <description>If you want to create a classifier, but you have an unequal number of observations for each class, then you have to be extra careful with how you estimate your model. If you have a highly imbalanced dataset and optimize for accuracy, then a model might simply predict the majority class in all cases.
A common way of dealling with this issue is downsampling, also known as undersampling. Downsampling means removing observations from the majority class(es) such that you have an equal number of observations for each class.</description>
