# How to 
"Doing Foo is important under the given conditions. I'm going to show you how to Foo. Do this, then do that. There, now I've shown you how to Foo. You should go out and do Foo."

# Story
"I'm going to tell you a story about Foo, how it taught me Bar, and led to Baz. First this happened, then that happened. And that's the story of Foo."

# Opinion
"Thesis. Points of evidence. Response to likely objections. Restatement of thesis." Just like we learned in high school. The most important thing is that you don't simply have an opinion, but you have a compelling and interesting argument to support it.

# How stuff works
"Do you wonder how Foo works? I'm going to show you how Foo is implemented. It does this and that. Now I've shown you how it works."

# Reviews
"I read, saw, played, or used something. This is what it is. This is what my experience was like. The thing has these strengths and weaknesses. In conclusion, it's best when evaluated by certain criteria."
